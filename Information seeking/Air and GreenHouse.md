##  Air and GreenHouse Gas Emissions
------------------------------------
### Interesting Aspect
   Climate change is important to understand and the percentage of greenhouse gases would help to predict how the climate will change 
   over next few decades, which is of vital importance for human existence. And I prefer to choose this topic for better understanding 
   on this issue.
   
### Description   
   Greenhouse gases refer to the sum of the gases that have direct imapcts on climate change. These seven gases are :
   carbon dioxide(CO2), methane(CH4), nitrous oxide(N20), chlorofluorocarbons(CFCs), hydroflourocarbons(HFCs), perflurocarbons(PFCs)
   superhexaflouride(SF6), nitrogen triflouride(NF3)
   The data are expressed in CO2 equivalents and refer to gross direct emissions from human activities. CO2 refers to gross direct 
   emissions from fuel combustion only and data are provided by the International Energy Agency.
   Air and greenhouse gas emissions are measured in thousand tonnes, tonnes per capita or kilogrammes per capita except for 
   CO2, which is measured in million tonnes and tonnes per capita.

   Government, Non-profit Organizations, Third party vendors.
  
 ### Questions that will be answered
 1. The amount of greenhouse gases emitted based on location.
 2. Annual estimation of greenhouse gas emission.
 3. Analysis of impact of greenhouse gases on climate change.
