 #  Five Millennium Catalog of Solar Eclipses
 -------------------------------------------------------
 ## Interesting Aspects
 The data about such natural phenomenon gives more information about the future occurences. This allows the scientists and the 
 Astrophysicists to estimate the future orbital occurence. 
 
 ## Description 
  Eclipses of the sun can only occur when the moon is near one of its orbital nodes[1] during the New Moon phase. Moon's penumbral, 
  umbral of antumbral shadows sweep across Earth's surface producing an eclipse. There are four types of solar eclipses: Partial,         
  Annular, Total and Hybrid.
