#  H-1B Program Data
--------------------------------------

## Interesting Aspects
   The H-1B visa is widely used as a long-term work visa in United States by giving a lengthy initial period of stay for many foreign 
   professionals to work. The data related to the numbers of H-1B visas issued allows the Government to focus on working professionals with caliber and talent.

## Description
   
The H1B is an employment-based, non-immigrant visa category for temporary foreign workers in the United States. For a foreign national to apply for H1B visa, 
an US employer must offer a job and petition for H1B visa with the US immigration department. This is the most common visa status applied for 
and held by international students once they complete college/ higher education (Masters, Ph.D.) and work in a full-time position.
A labor Condition Application is used by employers as supporting evidence for the petition for an H-1B visa. This archive includes
data from the LCA E-file online system or via the automated fax system. Data is available for both systems as separate files.
