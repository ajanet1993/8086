## 1.Air and GreenHouse Gas Emissions
------------------------------------
    
### Description   
   Greenhouse gases refer to the sum of the gases that have direct imapcts on climate change. These seven gases are :
   carbon dioxide(CO2), methane(CH4), nitrous oxide(N20), chlorofluorocarbons(CFCs), hydroflourocarbons(HFCs), perflurocarbons(PFCs)
   superhexaflouride(SF6), nitrogen triflouride(NF3)
   The data are expressed in CO2 equivalents and refer to gross direct emissions from human activities. CO2 refers to gross direct 
   emissions from fuel combustion only and data are provided by the International Energy Agency.
   Air and greenhouse gas emissions are measured in thousand tonnes, tonnes per capita or kilogrammes per capita except for 
   CO2, which is measured in million tonnes and tonnes per capita.

### Interesting Facts
   Climate change is important to understand and the percentage of greenhouse gases would help to predict how the climate will change 
   over next few decades, which is of vital importance for human existence. And I prefer to chose this topic for better understanding 
   on this issue.

### MetaData   
   The data consists of columns such as location, indicator, subject, measure, frequency, time, value, flag_codes. This file consists      of 8 columns and 24,948 rows.
   Size of the table- 1.35MB, Format: CSV

 ### Potential Users and Decision Makers
   Government, Non-profit Organizations, Third party ventors.
  
 ### Questions that will be answered
 1. The amount of greenhouse gases emitted based on location.
 2. Annual estimation of greenhouse gas emission.
 3. Analysis of impact of greenhouse gases on climate change.
 
 
 ## 2. Five Millennium Catalog of Solar Eclipses
 -------------------------------------------------------
 
 ### Description 
  Eclipses of the sun can only occur when the moon is near one of its orbital nodes[1] during the New Moon phase. Moon's penumbral,       umbral of antumbral shadows sweep across Earth's surface producing an eclipse. There are four types of solar eclipses: Partial,         Annular, Total and Hybrid.
    
 
 ### Interesting Facts
 The data about such natural phenomenon gives more information about the future occurences. This allows the scientists and the Astrophysicists to estimate the future orbital occurence. 
    
 ### MetaData
  Number of tables 5-20 (Depends upon the years you select). Each table consists of 17 columns and 251 rows. The file total size: 10 MB.
  Column Names are Catalog Number, Calendar Date, TD of Greatest Eclipse, Delta T, Luna Number, Saros Number, Lat. , Long. , Sun Alt,
  Sun Azm, Path Width, Central Duration, Gamma, QLE, Ecl. Mag, Ecl.Type.

 ### Potential Users
   Scientists, Third Party Users
    
 ### Questions that will be answered
 1. Estimate the future occurence of solar eclipse.
 2. Analyze the past occurences group by year and location.
 3. Estimate the average duration of the eclipse.
 
## 3. H-1B Program Data
--------------------------------------
### Description
   A labor Condition Application is used by employers as supporting evidence for the petition for an H-1B visa. This archive includes
   data from the LCA E-file online system or via the automated fax system. Data is available for both systems as separate files. 
 
### Interesting Facts
   The H-1B visa is widely used as a long-term work visa in United States by giving a lengthy initial period of stay for many foreign professionals to work. The data related to the numbers of H-1B visas issued allows the Government to focus on working professionals with calibre and talent.

### Metadata
   The file consists of 30 columns. Some of the columns are Submitted_data, Case_No, Program, Name, Address, Address2, City, State,        Postal_Code, Nbr_Immigrants, Begin_date, End_date, Job_title, Approval_Status, Certified_begin_date, Certified_end_date, Wage_rate_1    and so on.

### Potential Users
   Government, Social Media and Third Party vendors
 
### Questions that will be answered
  1. Estimate the working professionsl who apply for visa.
  2. EStimate the working professionals who are on wait.
  3. Analyze Approval_status.
