## 1.Air and GreenHouse Gas Emissions
    
### Description   
   Greenhouse gases refer to the sum of the gases that have direct imapcts on climate change. These seven gases are :
   carbon dioxide(CO2), methane(CH4), nitrous oxide(N20), chlorofluorocarbons(CFCs), hydroflourocarbons(HFCs), perflurocarbons(PFCs)
   superhexaflouride(SF6), nitrogen triflouride(NF3)
   The data are expressed in CO2 equivalents and refer to gross direct emissions from human activities. CO2 refers to gross direct 
   emissions from fuel combustion only and data are provided by the International Energy Agency.
   Air and greenhouse gas emissions are measured in thousand tonnes, tonnes per capita or kilogrammes per capita except for 
   CO2, which is measured in million tonnes and tonnes per capita.

### Interesting Facts
   Climate change is important to understand and the percentage of greenhouse gases would help to predict how the climate will change 
    over next few decades, which is of vital importance for human existence. And I prefer to chose this topic for better understanding 
    on this issue.

### MetaData   
   The data consists of columns such as location, indicator, subject, measure, frequency, time, value, flag_codes. This file consists       of 8 columns and 24,948 rows.
    Size of the table- 1.35MB, Format: CSV

 ## 2. Five Millennium Catalog of Solar Eclipses
 
 ### Description 
    Eclipses of the sun can only occur when the moon is near one of its orbital nodes[1] during the New Moon phase. Moon's penumbral,       umbral of antumbral shadows sweep across Earth's surface producing an eclipse. There are four types of solar eclipses: Partial,         Annular, Total and Hybrid.
